It deals with developing and analyzing protocols that prevents malicious third parties from retrieving information being shared between two entities thereby following the various aspects of information security. Secure Communication refers to the scenario where the message or data shared between two parties canâ€™t be accessed by an adversary. In Cryptography, an Adversary is a malicious entity, which aims to retrieve precious information or data thereby undermining the principles of information security. Data Confidentiality, Data Integrity, Authentication and Non-repudiation are core principles of modern-day cryptography.</textarea>
